*Summary: Monthly Zika cases diagnosed in Florida, USA associated with international travel. [Data here](https://github.com/andersen-lab/zika-epidemiology/)*

The Florida Department of Health kindly curated their [Weekly Arbovirus Reports](http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/surveillance.html) from 2016-2018 (last updated in June 2018) to build a database of travel-associated Zika virus cases to monitor for ongoing transmission throughout the Americas. The data is sorted by symptoms onset date (month) and origin of travel. Most of these cases were PCR positive and include both Florida residents and non-Florida residents that were seen/tested in Florida. There were some PCR positive cases in asymptomatic individuals that were not included. Those most often were pregnant women, and with the issues with possible prolonged viremia in this population, it is difficult to determine when they were actually exposed.
